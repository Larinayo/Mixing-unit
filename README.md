I'm at my 6th test in my FPGA Lab , the whole project is to create an audio-effect unit with the Altera de2-115 Cyclone IV.
And in the 6th test i'm supposed to create a mixing unit which mixes 2 elements components which are the s2p_units to get a p2s_unit. I have a 4 exercices :
1- Design the component Mixer-unit out of the mixer-unit entity . Instantiate the components s2p_unit and p2s_unit for the serial input and output of the audio signals.
2- Instantiate the component in the top-level-entity and connect it so the stereo-audiosignal will be mixed into a mono-audiosignal.    
3- Simulation with ModelSim and verficiation of the function of the Mixing-unit.
4- Run the synthesis in Quartus II.
I'll be forever in the debt of any good soul who's willing to help a poor student at his project ( ingeneering degree @ Uni-hannover)

Thanks in advance !
